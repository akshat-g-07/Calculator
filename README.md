# The Numb-erator
A calculator based on HTML, CSS and JS

This is the starting point of my Full Stack Development path i.e., my first project.

It will be a simple calculator to put my learnings of past 2 weeks into action and see some results.
Though in future, I am hoping to expand the scope to scientific calculator.

Hope all goes well.

All the best to me!!
